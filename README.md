# Backend Pizza App

[Demo](https://pizza-app-pravdin.herokuapp.com/)

The backend is made on Node and Express, authorization and authentication are configured using JWT-simple and Passport.js. I used MongoDB as a database and Mongoose as ODM.

To run the project, type command in terminal:

# nmp start

In the root directory there is a JSON file with a collection of pizzas for MongoDB

Insert link to connect MongoDB to server inside index.js
